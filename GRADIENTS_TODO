- delay/offset/non-sequential
- auto-open control (eg color) when choosing animated param
- opacity control in color picker (redo some of it using semantic-ui-react?)
  - lightness? what's the difference from value?
- reset mixin
- add more patterns
- export animation JS
- shorthand editor for animations? or just JS export?
- choose animation engine?
- UI transitions?
- choose pattern include previews
  - group by blend mode/normal
- document animation
- shorthand for background-position/-size?
- interface for animating position?
- UI controls based on type
  - boolean choose True/False
- package and document (incl link to sassdoc) mixins
  - change website dependency to package rather than file:../
  - same for react-color
- website:
  - blog post
  - https for website?
  - /projects/dutchkills?
- error messages when server fails to render sass
- make SCSS/CSS editable?
- make anime depend on tinycolor2?
- different styles of color transitions (eg darker)? what does it do currently? animate r, g, b, a separately? would animating h, s, v/l look different?
- mobile view
- link to original pattern
- measure frame rate
  - how much does reading current css val affect it? allow to specify whether to animate using current val (to allow simultaneous animations) or start val (to avoid checking current val)?
  - re-enable updating slider - optimize react re-render time to up frame rate?
- bundle size
- step styling - Preview/duration spacing
- hearts sizing
  - color darkmagenta background-color aquamarine
- yin yang rename size param to big/outer circle size
  - size animation doesn't work - inner circles don't position correctly
- marrakesh: add params for ring start/thickness
- band-weave: name viking? add start/end outlines? different inner/outer ring colors (10% lighter?)
- jacks:
  - pull in stroke-color cutoff circle (based on dot/stroke width?) so that at eg smaller dot size less likely to be revealed
  - allow stagger?
  - bottom half?
  - make leftmost/rightmost strokes a little more than a quarter, their edge is exposed at size > ~35%
- highlight steps as they're running?
- make sure elasticity has no effect except when elastic easing selected
- elasticity control - slider? min/max number? label max 1000?
- how to handle connected/relative defaults?
- shake (ie easing ends where it starts)?
- allow to use up/down arrow keys to adjust input values?
- disable things/indicate loading while waiting for server to render sass?
  - cached (server-side) initial css?
  - batch step calls?
- support relative units when animating gradients?
- is HSV calculation funky in color picker?
- preview button weirdness - says preview checked but can drag around timeline and doesn't uncheck
  - and play button stays as pause button
- initial value when adding animated param should come from prev step, not initial value
- animation steps don't update corresponding params when mixin arg changed
- should reset to customize tab when new pattern selected?
- animations should fail gracefully on browsers that don't support gradients
  - check them cross-browser
