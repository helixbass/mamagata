- color picker: click to revert back to current color? HSLV? color names? is HSV calculation funky?
- reset mixin
- shorthand editor for animations?
- choose animation engine?
- UI transitions?
- document animation
- interface for animating position?
- UI controls based on type
  - hue?
- website:
  - blog post
  - https for website?
  - /projects/dutchkills?
  - google analytics
- error messages when server fails to render sass
- make SCSS/CSS editable?
- make anime depend on tinycolor2?
- different styles of color transitions (eg darker)? what does it do currently? animate r, g, b, a separately? would animating h, s, v/l look different?
  - add this to (fork of) tinycolor2? as pluggable?
- step styling - Preview/duration spacing
- hearts sizing
  - color darkmagenta background-color aquamarine
- yin yang rename size param to big/outer circle size
  - size animation doesn't work - inner circles don't position correctly
- marrakesh: add params for ring start/thickness
- argyle: allow to change angle?
- viking: add start/end outlines? different inner/outer ring colors (10% lighter?)
- jacks:
  - pull in stroke-color cutoff circle (based on dot/stroke width?) so that at eg smaller dot size less likely to be revealed
  - allow stagger?
  - bottom half?
  - make leftmost/rightmost strokes a little more than a quarter, their edge is exposed at size > ~35%
- highlight steps as they're running?
- make sure elasticity has no effect except when elastic easing selected
- elasticity control - slider? min/max number? label max 1000?
- connected/relative defaults
  - show $set-relative control at top (using parsed dependencies?)?
  - somehow indicate (eg dimming out) when a param is being controlled so the value you're seeing isn't right?
- shake (ie easing ends where it starts)?
- allow to use up/down arrow keys to adjust input values?
- batch step calls?
- support relative units when animating gradients?
- preview button weirdness - says preview checked but can drag around timeline and doesn't uncheck
  - and play button stays as pause button
- should reset to customize tab when new pattern selected?
- animations should fail gracefully on browsers that don't support gradients
  - check them cross-browser
- demos
- What's this page about? Modal explaining usage and links to libs
  - animation guide
- adjust some previews to show better: wave, svg logo
- angle changes when animating eg chard stripe width (to top left, to top right become 315deg, 45deg)
  - and first transparent stop doesn't change, is this related?
- why doesn't animating scale of finger wave or drops work?
  - it's b/c it seems to be converting background-size from em -> px (so when getting computed value, it's returning px)
- allow to export sass for any given step?
- before (the previous step ends) is resetting to after when editing ms
- step start:
  - allow to stop editing start offset (and use abs offset value in text)
  - allow ends/starts?
  - allow to choose other step besides previous?
- load saved:
  - show most recent first?
  - can right-align dropdown so not cut off?
  - allow to delete saved?
- make mamagata public
- "pop" seekIgnoreOffset (in anime) so that it doesn't try and treat it like an animated property
