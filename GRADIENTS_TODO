  - and play button stays as pause button
- step styling - Preview/duration spacing
- hearts sizing

  - pull in stroke-color cutoff circle (based on dot/stroke width?) so that at eg smaller dot size less likely to be revealed
  - allow stagger?
  - bottom half?
- highlight steps as they're running?
- make sure elasticity has no effect except when elastic easing selected
- elasticity control - slider? min/max number? label max 1000?

- initial value when adding animated param should come from prev step, not initial value
- handle eg %Modal.Header
- shake (ie easing ends where it starts)?
- add eslint (undefined used vars) to build
- allow to use up/down arrow keys to adjust input values?
- support animating radial position (eg circle at x% y%) so that eg animating jacks size works
- disable things/indicate loading while waiting for server to render sass?
- support relative units when animating gradients?
